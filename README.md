# Nodejs-Mongodb
This is the project for learning how to use Mongo DB with Nodejs Driver.
It is more understandable if one is familiar with Mongo Compass GUI and its CLI.
So I will share how you can pull this repo and run it on your local, just not nowðŸ˜œ

So I love working with MongoDB, got to know collections and JSON(i already knew Json, what am I saying)

Happy Coding!
